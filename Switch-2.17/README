                      Release of version 2.17 of Switch
==============================================================================


NAME
    Switch - A switch statement for Perl, do not use if you can use given/when

DESCRIPTION

    Switch.pm provides the syntax and semantics for an explicit case
    mechanism for Perl. The syntax is minimal, introducing only the
    keywords C<switch> and C<case> and conforming to the general pattern
    of existing Perl control structures. The semantics are particularly
    rich, allowing any one (or more) of nearly 30 forms of matching to
    be used when comparing a switch value with its various cases.
